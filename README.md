# Customer Churn Capstone Project
## Problem Statement: 
You are the Data Scientist at a telecom company “Neo” whose customers are churning out to
its competitors. You have to analyse the data of your company and find insights and stop your
customers from churning out to other telecom companies. 

## Project Overview
In this capstone project, I utilized Python and various libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, exploratory analysis, and visualization. The dataset was imported from a CSV file and underwent thorough exploration to gain insights into the data. Key patterns and trends related to customer churn were identified.

Next, I performed data preprocessing using Sklearn's LabelEncoder to handle categorical variables and the StandardScaler to standardize the data. This step ensured the data was ready for model training.

I built several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest, to predict customer churn. Model performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy score, R2 score, and RMSE.

To optimize the models, I employed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, resulting in improved accuracy scores.
